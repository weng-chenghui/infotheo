Section dsdp_security_indcpa.

(* AHE scheme is parametric, matching the existing project convention
   from dsdp_pismc.v. *)
Variable AHE : AHEncType.

(* Design Commitment 1 (Rocq audit).  rand AHE is declared as Type in
   homomorphic_encryption/he_types.v:40.  SSProve cannot sample over a
   bare Type.  This scaffold introduces a refined finType carrier Renc
   for the encryption randomness; later instantiation against a
   concrete scheme (Benaloh/Paillier) identifies Renc with rand AHE. *)
Variable Renc : finType.

(* Cardinality index for [sample uniform].  The hypothesis [renc_card]
   below ties [#|Renc|] to [index_renc] so the SSProve uniform sample
   value can be lifted to an [Renc] value via [enum_val]. *)
Variable index_renc : nat.
Hypothesis renc_card : #|Renc| = index_renc.

(** sample_to_renc — convert an SSProve uniform-index value
    ['I_index_renc] to an [Renc] value by routing through [enum_val] and
    the cardinality cast.
    Kind: helper.
    Why: [sample uniform index_renc] returns an ['I_index_renc]; the AHE
    encryption requires an [Renc]-shaped value (after passing through
    [rand_of_renc]).  This is the same plumbing as in
    [homomorphic_encryption/indcpa_ror.v].
    Used by: game_real, game_hybrid_one, game_hybrid_two. *)
Definition sample_to_renc (i : 'I_index_renc) : Renc :=
  enum_val (cast_ord (esym renc_card) i).

(** rand_of_renc — bridge from the SSProve-side finType [Renc] to the
    AHE-side encryption-randomness type [rand AHE].  Same Section
    parameter as in [homomorphic_encryption/indcpa_ror.v]. *)
Variable rand_of_renc : Renc -> rand AHE.

(* Section-parametric carriers for the SSProve [choice_type] message and
   ciphertext spaces, with conversions to/from the AHE [plain]/[cipher]
   types.  Mirrors indcpa_ror.v so the two files share interface shapes. *)

(* Public-key supply per party, again parametric (no commitment to a
   specific key-generation strategy). *)
Variable pkey_of_party : party_id -> pub_key AHE.

(* Index for the protocol-level scalar carrier ('Z_m or 'F_m in the
   instantiated proof; here abstracted as a finType-indexed uniform).
   The three protocol-side random variables V_1, V_2, V_3, U_1, U_2, U_3,
   R_2, R_3 are all sampled from this carrier.  index_msg gives its
   cardinality so [sample uniform index_msg] is well-typed. *)
Variable index_msg : nat.

(** msg_of_idx — bridge from the SSProve uniform-sample index
    ['I_index_msg] to a [plain AHE] value.  Section-parametric: a
    concrete instantiation supplies the cardinality bridge and the
    enumeration.
    Kind: helper.
    Why: SSProve samples take a [nat] cardinality, but the protocol-level
    arithmetic in DSDP operates on [plain AHE].  This indirection lets
    the same game definitions instantiate against different concrete
    plaintext carriers (e.g. ['F_m] or ['Z_(p*q)]) without retyping.
    Used by: game_real, game_hybrid_one, game_hybrid_two. *)
Variable msg_of_idx : 'I_index_msg -> plain AHE.

Local Notation "'cipher_t'" := t_cipher (in custom pack_type at level 2).

(** cipher_list — the choice_type carrier for the return-value
    accumulator: an SSProve list of ciphertexts.  Each game produces a
    value of this type as its single observable output.
    Kind: canonical.
    Why: Design Commitment 3 (Rocq audit).  [Send<dst> v ; P] threads [v]
    into a return-value accumulator.  All four games share this
    accumulator type so they can be composed/contrasted via
    [AdvantageE].
    Used by: game_iface, game_real, game_hybrid_one, game_hybrid_two,
    game_leak. *)
Definition cipher_list : choice_type := chList t_cipher.

Local Notation "'ciphers'" := cipher_list (in custom pack_type at level 2).

(** id_game_run — the single operation identifier exported by every
    game.  Calling it executes the joint protocol run and returns the
    ciphertext accumulator visible to corrupted Alice.
    Kind: canonical.
    Why: SSProve operations are identified by a [nat]; a single shared
    identifier across the four games keeps [game_iface] unique so
    [AdvantageE] is well-typed.
    Used by: game_iface and all four game packages. *)
Definition id_game_run : nat := 0%N.

(** game_iface — the shared export interface of the four games.  Each
    game exports a single operation [id_game_run] taking ['unit] and
    returning the ciphertext accumulator [ciphers].
    Kind: canonical.
    Why: the SSProve advantage [AdvantageE G_0 G_1 A] requires both
    games to share their export interface.  The IND-CPA hops in Task 08
    chain four games against this single shared signature.
    Used by: game_real, game_hybrid_one, game_hybrid_two, game_leak,
    and the Task 08 advantage triangle. *)
Definition game_iface : Interface :=
  [interface #val #[ id_game_run ] : 'unit → ciphers ].

(** game_real — package modelling the real DSDP execution.  Samples the
    protocol-level random variables (V_2, V_3, U_2, U_3, R_2, R_3) and
    Bob/Charlie/Alice's encryption-randomness uniformly, computes
    Bob-to-Alice c_2 = Enc(pk_bob, V_2, r_b1) and Charlie-to-Alice
    c_3 = Enc(pk_charlie, V_3, r_c1), and the two Alice-to-Bob/Charlie
    ciphertexts a_1, a_2 from the homomorphic operations on (c_2, c_3,
    U_2, U_3, R_2, R_3, r_a1, r_a2).  Returns the four-element list
    [a_1; a_2; c_2; c_3] (the ciphertext slots leaked to corrupted
    Alice).
    Kind: main.
    Why: Task 06 of the plan.  This is the start of the hybrid chain;
    the IND-CPA hops replace c_2 and c_3 with zero-encryptions, then the
    residual leak is collapsed in [game_leak].
    Used by: Tasks 07 (reductions), 08 (advantage triangle). *)

    Distinguishing it from [game_real] reduces to IND-CPA security of
    the AHE scheme on Charlie's public key (via [reduction_charlie] in
    Task 07).
    Kind: main.
    Why: Task 06 of the plan.  Strips the V_3 dependency from the
    Charlie ciphertext slot while leaving the Bob slot real.  The IND-CPA
    advantage of [game_real] vs [game_hybrid_one] is bounded by
    [epsilon_cpa].

    Both ciphertext slots are now zero-encryptions; only the random
    deterministic algebra over (V_2, U_2, U_3, R_2, R_3) plus the
    encryption-randomness terms remain.
    Kind: main.
    Why: Task 06 of the plan.  Second IND-CPA hop, symmetric to the
    Charlie hop.  After this hop, [game_hybrid_two] is identical in
    distribution to [game_leak] modulo a deterministic post-processing
    (Task 09 closes that equivalence).

(** game_leak — ciphertext-free residual.  Returns an empty ciphertext
    list, modelling the worldwhere all four ciphertext slots have been
    replaced by deterministic functions of fresh encryption-randomness
    independent of (V_2, V_3, U_2, U_3, R_2, R_3).  Used to close the
    advantage triangle in Task 08.
    Kind: main.
    Why: Task 06 of the plan.  Once both IND-CPA hops have been taken,
    the remaining ciphertext content is independent of the protocol
    secret V_2.  Returning the empty accumulator makes this explicit at
    the package level.  The residual uniformity argument
